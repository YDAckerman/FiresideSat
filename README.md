# FiresideSat

## About

FiresideSat is a tool combining Twilio, AWS Lambda, and a few
fire-tracking API's to allow backpackers (or anyone with a sat-phone)
to get real-time, location-specific, wildfire and smoke information. 

The project is a work in progress. This repository only tracks the
python code I've been developing. To function, additional work needs
to be done setting up a Twilio messaging system with an AWS Lambda
function. This can easily be done following a few simple tutorials,
but I'll track my own path either here or on some blogging platform
when I get the chance.

## Goals

As I was recently reminded, fire perimeters are only part of the
problem when one is off-grid. Smoke and air-quality tracking and
predition would also be incredibly useful services. I am currently
incorporating already extant API's for this purpose. However
doing so will likely require a different architecture that what I have
currently set up.
